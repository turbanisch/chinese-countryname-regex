# Regular expressions to match country names in Chinese

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Challenges

Coming up with regular expressions to match country names in Chinese is slightly more involved than for other languages. The reason is that different parts of the world use different variants of Chinese, beyond the basic distinction between simplified and traditional characters. Mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore all use simplified characters whereas Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan continue to use traditional characters -- but local usage may vary within each group. 

This is especially true for proper names like country names. Not only can they vary character by character depending on the script that is used, but they might also reflect different (phonetic) transliterations or refer to another name altogether. Here are some examples for each case:

1. **Different scripts.** Germany is referred to as *Deguo* 德国 in Mainland China and 德國 in Taiwan -- where 国 is the simplified character corresponding to 國, easy. However, there are some less obvious cases, as we will see below.
2. **Different transliterations**. Many country names have been phonetically adapted from other languages and translators in every Chinese-speaking region have taken their artistic liberties when doing so. For example, Hong Kongers refer to Barbados as *Babaduosi* 巴巴多斯 whereas people from Taiwan call it *Babeiduo* 巴貝多.
3. **Alternative names**. Instead of adapting a country name according to its sound, Chinese-speaking people in some regions have also opted to convert the original meaning of the country name into Chinese. For example, Montenegro is *Heishan* 黑山 ("black mountain") in Mainland China. People on Taiwan, on the other hand, kept their phonetic transliteration *Mengteneigeluo* 蒙特內哥羅.

## Proposed solution

The issue of different scripts could be solved in two ways: either by harmonizing the scripts with some automatic conversion procedure or writing complex regular expressions that match any script. I discuss the two approaches below in the section on testing my regular expressions and focus on the second issue here. 

The issues of different transliterations and alternative country names call for the same solution: coming up with a list of country names from each Chinese-speaking region. The regular expressions need to be able to match each element of these lists. Luckily, Wikipedia not only records the official country name, the colloquial country name as well as name variants; it does so for flavors of Chinese from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan.

Wikipedia even offers an [overview page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/世界政區索引) with full and short country names. This page alone is not sufficient for two reasons. First, it does not include any name variants; second, it contains errors (Ghana's full name is written using the traditional character 迦 while the short name contains the simplified 加). 

But since the overview page provides links to the individual country pages, it can serve as an entry point for web crawling. On each page, Wikipedia's localization not only takes care of character-by-character conversion but also reflects differences in usage described above, as the following example of Montenegro shows:

![Mainland](img/montenegro_mainland.png)

![Taiwan](img/montenegro_taiwan.png)

## Procedure

1. Scrape country names from each country page (in each language variant). I use the article heading as the short name, the first name in the first sentence as the official name, and all other names in the first sentence (typeset in bold) as name variants. 
2. Convert all country names to simplified characters and identify the longest common substring. This substring serves as a basis for developing regular expressions manually. If a substring entirely matches one of the country name, I use it as the regular expression and overwrite it only in case of ambiguity (e.g., Congo 刚果).
3. Manually develop regular expressions including lookarounds to distinguish the various Guineas and similar cases from each other. Out of the variants in my list, I only ignore transliterations from the local language (e.g., *Aoteyaluowa* 奥特亚罗瓦 for New Zealand) and the ones that are obviously outdated (such as *Bulukeba* 布魯克巴, apparently used for Bhutan during the Qing dynasty). The resulting regular expressions should be fairly specific but still assume that the input is a country name of some sort. Otherwise, the regular expression for Western Sahara (`西撒哈拉|撒哈?拉.*民主共和国`) might also match the geographical term for the western part of the Sahara desert, and so on.
4. Merge ISO3 codes and regular expressions to the conversion table comprising short and full names in all language variants.
5. Test the regular expressions against all variants (in simplified Chinese) below.

## File and variable descriptions

### Files

All output files are saved in `data/`. The one that includes regular expressions and can be used as a conversion table is `dict.csv`.

- `countrynames.csv`: Short name, full (official) name and name variants for each language variant
- `dict.csv`: Only short and full (official) name for each language variant but including ISO3 codes and regular expressions. 
- `overview.csv`: Links to country-specific Wikipedia pages.

### Language variant codes
```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  Code = c("zh_cn", "zh_hk", "zh_mo", "zh_my", "zh_sg", "zh_tw"),
  "Description (Chinese)" = c("大陆简体", "香港繁體", "澳門繁體", "大马简体", "新加坡简体", "臺灣正體"),
  "Description (English)" = c("Mainland (simplified)", "Hong Kong (traditional)", "Macau (traditional)", "Malaysia (simplified)", "Singapore (simplified)", "Taiwan (traditional)")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Making regexes work for traditional Chinese

As stated above, there are broadly to ways of making my regular expressions (in simplified Chinese) work for variants using traditional Chinese: first, a two-step approach that converts the input into simplified Chinese and then matches the regular expressions; and second, expanding the regular expressions themselves to capture any character variants.

Although the two-step approach has some caveats, I prefer it over the second one. The reason for my preference comes down to better maintenance. The simplified regular expressions already contain case distinctions (e.g., `西班牙|(日斯|以西)(巴|把)(尼|你)亚`). By adding character variants by hand, the expressions would quickly become convoluted. Another question is feasibility: depending on your font, you might not even spot all character variants unless you employ some testing routines:

```{r}
# different unicode character, invisible
identical("阿布哈茲","阿布哈兹")
```



Therefore, first converting to simplified (with the same engine that I used to create the regexes) is prefered.
